Sorry about ga1 and ga2 - bad names, but it marries up with the article in Overload showing the thought process.

Need to do crossover properly
	use the last height as a input - maybe save it on the end of generation info, or with True/False at end
	add some tests for it (and muttate)

Show how many escaped on each graph

I keep making mistakes with the boolean in results and escaped.... Perhaps I should store the result of escaped, or drop the booleans

I don't like the height and width - it's asking to end up the wrong way round
